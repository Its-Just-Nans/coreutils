.SH DESCRIPTION
Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-target\-directory\fR=\fItarget\-directory\fR
copy all SOURCE arguments into target\-directory

Treat DEST as a regular file and not a directory
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
ask before overwriting files
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-link\fR
hard\-link files instead of copying
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-clobber\fR
don\*(Aqt overwrite a file that already exists
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
copy directories recursively
.TP
\fB\-\-strip\-trailing\-slashes\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
explain how a file is copied. Implies \-v
.TP

\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-symbolic\-link\fR

.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again (this option is ignored when the \-n option is also used). Currently not implemented for Windows.
.TP
\fB\-\-remove\-destination\fR
remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it (contrast with \-\-force). On Windows, currently only works for writeable files.
.TP
\fB\-\-backup\fR=\fICONTROL\fR
make a backup of each existing destination file
.TP
\fB\-b\fR
like \-\-backup but does not accept an argument
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-suffix\fR=\fISUFFIX\fR
override the usual backup suffix
.TP
\fB\-\-update\fR
move only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing
.br

.br
[\fIpossible values: \fRnone, all, older]
.TP
\fB\-u\fR
like \-\-update but does not accept an argument
.TP
\fB\-\-reflink\fR=\fIWHEN\fR

[\fIpossible values: \fRauto, always, never]
.TP
\fB\-\-attributes\-only\fR
Don\*(Aqt copy the file data, just the attributes
.TP
\fB\-\-preserve\fR=\fIATTR_LIST\fR
Preserve the specified attributes (default: mode, ownership (unix only), timestamps), if possible additional attributes: context, links, xattr, all

never follow symbolic links in SOURCE
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-dereference\fR
always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

Display a progress bar. 
Note: this feature is not supported by GNU coreutils.

.SH EXTRA
Do not copy a non\-directory that has an existing destination with the same or newer modification timestamp;
instead, silently skip the file without failing. If timestamps are being preserved, the comparison is to the
source timestamp truncated to the resolutions of the destination file system and of the system calls used to
update timestamps; this avoids duplicate work if several cp \-pu commands are executed with the same source
and destination. This option is ignored if the \-n or \-\-no\-clobber option is also specified. Also, if
\-\-preserve=links is also specified (like with cp \-au for example), that will take precedence; consequently,
depending on the order that files are processed from the source, newer files in the destination may be replaced,
to mirror hard links in the source. which gives more control over which existing files in the destination are
replaced, and its value can be one of the following:

* all    This is the default operation when an \-\-update option is not specified, and results in all existing files in the destination being replaced.
* none   This is similar to the \-\-no\-clobber option, in that no files in the destination are replaced, but also skipping a file does not induce a failure.
* older  This is the default operation when \-\-update is specified, and results in files being replaced if theyâ€™re older than the corresponding source file.

The backup suffix is \*(Aq~\*(Aq, unless set with \-\-suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.
The version control method may be selected via the \-\-backup option or through
the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

  none, off       never make backups (even if \-\-backup is given)
  numbered, t     make numbered backups
  existing, nil   numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
  simple, never   always make simple backups
