.SH EXTRA
When specifying more than one of \-i, \-f, \-n, only the final one will take effect.

Do not move a non\-directory that has an existing destination with the same or newer modification timestamp;
instead, silently skip the file without failing. If the move is across file system boundaries, the comparison is
to the source timestamp truncated to the resolutions of the destination file system and of the system calls used
to update timestamps; this avoids duplicate work if several mv \-u commands are executed with the same source
and destination. This option is ignored if the \-n or \-\-no\-clobber option is also specified. which gives more control
over which existing files in the destination are replaced, and its value can be one of the following:

* all    This is the default operation when an \-\-update option is not specified, and results in all existing files in the destination being replaced.
* none   This is similar to the \-\-no\-clobber option, in that no files in the destination are replaced, but also skipping a file does not induce a failure.
* older  This is the default operation when \-\-update is specified, and results in files being replaced if theyâ€™re older than the corresponding source file.

The backup suffix is \*(Aq~\*(Aq, unless set with \-\-suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.
The version control method may be selected via the \-\-backup option or through
the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

  none, off       never make backups (even if \-\-backup is given)
  numbered, t     make numbered backups
  existing, nil   numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
  simple, never   always make simple backups
